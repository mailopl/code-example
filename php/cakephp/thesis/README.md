My thesis application - apigeum is a software that will let you create Flat File Database (repository) and share it through REST API.

There are two kinds of repositories (made of rows and columns) that one can create: free and paid.
Once you create a paid "repository", the users can buy a key that allows them to use certain amount of requests.

Access to the repository is possible through a web browser or REST API.

Further description is available via Wawrzyniak-Marcin-Thesis-Polish.pdf (only Polish language).

Technical stuff:
- PHP 5.2+
- CakePHP 2.0+
- jQuery 1.7+
- Codeception test framework
- MySQL 5
- MongoDb
