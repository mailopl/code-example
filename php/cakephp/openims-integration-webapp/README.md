"The Open IMS Core is an Open Source implementation of IMS Call Session Control Functions (CSCFs) and a lightweight Home Subscriber Server (HSS), which together form the core elements of all IMS/NGN architectures as specified today within 3GPP, 3GPP2, ETSI TISPAN and the PacketCable intiative."

This project integrates with the HSS database of the OpenIMS system, additionally allowing to maintain some billing tasks (payments) and more:
- edit user data (user profile)
- CRUD of related "protocols", "utility functions" and "parameters"
- each parameter can have a default value (like bitrate)
- each utility function can have any number of parameters
- each user can be manually "supercharged" by the system administrator with certain amount of cash
- REST API layer
